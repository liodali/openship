/**
 * Discovery reconciler (docs/docker-service-discovery-plan.md, step 4).
 *
 * Consumes the scanner's desired-state queue and applies it to the serving
 * server's Openship Edge. Per enabled server, one pass:
 *
 *  1. WITHDRAWALS first — bindings flagged `withdrawalPending` (blocked or
 *     suppressed owners included): retire the application route, clear the
 *     flag. Blocking forbids forward applies; it never strands a live route.
 *  2. Due applies (pending/error, backoff elapsed, not suppressed):
 *     - missing/invalid/stopped observation → RETAIN the hostname as an
 *       unavailable vhost when a route was applied before: `return 503;` with
 *       TLS and both ACME challenge locations kept, so the certificate
 *       lifecycle continues and clients see "backend unavailable" instead of
 *       the default-server page (docs: "Retain an unavailable vhost with
 *       TLS/challenge handling while a backend is absent"). The domain row
 *       and certificate material stay. A binding that was never applied has
 *       no vhost to retain — plain removeRoute. Explicit withdrawal (blocked
 *       or suppressed owner, above) is full retirement, never retention.
 *     - observed+running → registerRoute against the resolved upstream:
 *       bridge-ip → `http://<ip>:<port>`; published-port → the container's
 *       observed loopback binding `http://127.0.0.1:<hostPort>` — a remote
 *       server's loopback is THAT server's, never the API host's, and the
 *       host-port claim subsystem proves ownership before anything dials it
 *       (the publish is OBSERVED from the container; no allocator runs).
 *       Registering over a retained unavailable vhost is the resume path.
 *  3. Success is `markApplied(desiredGeneration)` only after the edge write
 *     returned; the DB write alone is never "active". Failures persist
 *     backoff via markApplyError and retry on a later pass.
 *
 * Upstreams are probed from the routing provider's own network namespace, with
 * fresh container inspection before selection and before the route write.
 * Route repair from durable records lives in discovery-repair.ts; the sweep and
 * lifecycle watchers that drive both are step 5. The route writer is the
 * adapter's own `routing.registerRoute`; no project wrapper is faked (docs:
 * "must not call a wrapper that demands an active deployment").
