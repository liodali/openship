/**
 * Fork patch guard — fails CI the moment one of our Podman-compatibility
 * patches stops being intact after an upstream merge.
 *
 * Run by .github/workflows/fork-sync.yml AFTER `git merge upstream/main` and
 * BEFORE anything is pushed. A structural check, not a test suite: it answers
 * one question fast — "did upstream refactor the exact code our patches
 * live in?" — with a message that names the patch, not a stack trace.
 *
 *   node scripts/fork/patch-guard.mjs
 *
 * The three Podman patches (openship-podman-compatibility.md, Option A):
 *   1. extrahosts JSON        — dockerode build request is spec-correct
 *   2. builder mode/fallback  — OPENSHIP_BUILDER_MODE + /session-404 fallback
 *   3. nginx Connection map   — $connection_upgrade instead of "upgrade"
 * Plus two fork-identity/UX patches:
 *   4. fork badge             — dashboard sidebar marks our build (fork-badge.tsx)
 *   5. folder-deploy routes   — SDK passes scan publicEndpoints to ensure + build/access
 *   6. hosted-only own domain — no synthesized *.opsh.io routes on self-hosted
 *   7. podman actions runner  — daemon probe fallback + runner container flags
 *                              + failed-session retry + bot rerun admission +
 *                              heartbeat sweep (openship-actions-runner-podman-fixes.md)
 *   8. self-app api domain    — api.<box-domain> may route the admin API port
 *                              (0.9.5 guard exempts the dashboard only)
 *   9. host-key from= own IP  — provisioner allowlists the box's own IPv4
 *                              (pasta-forwarded channel source, podman VPS)
 *
 * WHEN UPSTREAM ADOPTS THE SAME FIX: resolve the merge by taking THEIR version
 * and delete that check here. Every merged upstream PR shrinks the fork back
 * toward a pure mirror — this file is the ledger of what is still ours.
